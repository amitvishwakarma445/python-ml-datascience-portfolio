'''
The __init__.py file is a Python file that is executed when a package is imported.
__init__.py is a special file used in Python to define packages and initialize their namespaces.
 
It can contain an initialization code that runs when the package is imported.
Without this file, Python won't recognize a directory as a package. It serves two main purposes:

-> 1. It marks the directory as a Python Package so that the interpreter can find the modules inside it.
-> 2. It can contain initialization code for the Package, such as importing submodules, defining variables, or executing other code.
